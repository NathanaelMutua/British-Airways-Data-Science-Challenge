# British Airways Data Science Challenge

## Description
My solutions for the Forage program: are web scraping, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to extract business insights. 

Demonstrating practical data science skills for real-world problem-solving.

## Task 1
### 1. Scrape data from the web
The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the site [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/)

I will use Jupyter Notebook to perform data gathering, cleaning, and analysis.

### 2. Clean the Data
Start by cleaning your messy text dataset to prepare it for analysis.

Explore insights using techniques like topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds.

### 3. Present Insights
Summarize your key findings in a single PowerPoint slide.

Include visualizations, metrics, and clear explanations to convey the results quickly.
