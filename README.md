# **British Airways Data Science Internship**

## **Description**
My solutions for the Forage program: are web scraping, data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to extract business insights. 

Demonstrating practical data science skills for real-world problem-solving.

## **Task 1**
### **1. Scrape data from the web**
The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the site [Skytrax](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/)

I will use Jupyter Notebook to perform data gathering, cleaning, and analysis.

### **2. Clean the Data**
Starting by cleaning our messy text dataset to prepare it for analysis.

Explore insights using techniques like topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds.

### **3. Present Insights**
Summarize my key findings in a single PowerPoint slide.

Include visualizations, metrics, and clear explanations to convey my results quickly.
